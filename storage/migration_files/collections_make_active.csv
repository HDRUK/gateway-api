100k Synthetic Brains (DDPM),100k Synthetic Brains (DDPM),"The Synthetic Brain Project is focused on building deep learning models that can synthesize high-resolution morphologically-correct 3D MRI images of human brains.
 
These models and datasets will help scientists pave the way toward better federated-learning setups, more robust models under limited data, safer AI, and improved anomaly detection.
 
The AI models were developed by King’s and NVIDIA scientists and engineers as part of The London Medical Imaging & AI Centre for Value-Based Healthcare research funded by UK Research and Innovation and a Wellcome Flagship Programme (in collaboration with University College London).  The dataset is composed of over 100,000 T1w 1mm isotropic synthetic brains of different gender, ages, ventricular sizes and size to head ratios.
 
The code and models will soon be made available as open-source upon publication. Two twin-datasets are being released, utilising two state-of-the-art generative models, one using demonising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), and another using transformers. This specific dataset has been generated using DDPMs. The 100k samples have been generated using a uniformly sampled conditioning vector across ages, sexes, and brain size.

Better Care,Better Care,"**Aim**

Health Data Research UK’s [Better Care programme](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/how-we-use-health-data/better-care/) aims to improve people’s lives by equipping clinicians and patients in the UK with the best possible data-based information to make decisions about their care.

Our vision is that by 2030, patients across the UK will benefit from healthcare decisions informed by large scale data and advanced analytics to identify what will work best for them.

**Our approach**

We support the development of learning healthcare systems that integrate clinical practice, large scale data and advanced analytics in a cycle of continuous improvement by:

- Systematically gathering real-world data about patients’ treatment, experience and outcomes within the setting of routine care
- Collating and providing access to large scale data in a format that is analysis-ready
- Using advanced analytics to derive generalisable evidence and provide critical insights into healthcare delivery
- Developing data-driven tools that make these insights actionable by clinicians and patients when they are making decisions about their care
- Implementing tools to support personalised decision making by clinicians and patients at the point of care
- Gathering data to manage the quality, safety and efficiency of care delivery, underpin research, and generate new insights that can continuously improve decision-making by clinicians and patients
- Our focus is on answering the research questions necessary to achieve these goals and seeking solutions that can be implemented at scale across the health and care system.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated health datasets across the four nations of the UK.

The consortium has over 380 members across more than 50 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of principles with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.

Approved researchers access data within secure trusted research environments (TREs) provided by NHS England in England, the National Data Safe Haven in Scotland, the SAIL Databank in Wales and the Honest Broker Service in Northern Ireland.

Linkable datasets include those from primary and secondary care, COVID lab tests and vaccinations, deaths, critical care, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular and stroke audits, maternity services and mental health.

Building on the success of CVD-COVID-UK, the BHF Data Science Centre has now gained ethical and regulatory approval to broaden the scope of the programme to all COVID-related research (in NHS England’s TRE for England only).  This is known as COVID-IMPACT and it helps to support research projects from the wider community.

CO-CONNECT,CO-CONNECT,"CO-CONNECT Project (https://co-connect.ac.uk/):

The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, severely strained health systems and damaged economies across the world. At this time there is limited evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection and if so, how long that lasts. Understanding who is immune is vital to protect vulnerable individuals, to safely scale back population-based interventions and for managing disease transmission.  

The data which can help us to answer these key questions have been collected across the UK by a range of research groups and within routine clinical primary and secondary care settings. As this is a new disease the standards for antibody data capture are in their infancy so some of the details needed to answer the key questions are not being captured systematically. The fragmented landscape of data means that it can be challenging for public health groups and researchers to find and access the high-quality data they need at pace.  

CO-CONNECT will:  

- Provide a mechanism, via the HDR Gateway, to allow researchers to find what relevant datasets reside where and under what access conditions 
- Configure an infrastructure which enables trustworthy, fast, de-identified, secure analysis of data from across multiple organisations  
- Standardise antibody data collection across the UK  
- Align with the National Core Studies programme 
- Answer key questions about immunity to COVID-19 and the implications for patient outcomes.

Cohort Discovery ,Cohort Discovery ,"Cohort Discovery is a Gateway feature that allows users to carry out a more specific search and assessment on a subset of datasets listed in the Gateway, without having access to the underlying data.

Users can specify defined characteristics relevant to their proposed analysis (e.g. patients that don’t smoke aged between 18-30 and who live in England) through the Cohort Discovery user interface. This requirement is then sent as a query to multiple pseudonymised datasets, with results returned in the form of a numerical count of individuals that meet those criteria.

Undertaking Cohort Discovery before requesting access to the relevant data improves research productivity, by avoiding requests for data not suitable for the research need and by improving the specificity of future data access requests where a cohort of sufficient size is identified.

This collection shows you the datasets that are currently onboarded onto Cohort Discovery. Further datasets will be added over the coming months.

1. What are the mental health consequences of C-19 infection, and of viral suppression measures? How do these differ by key demographics, socioeconomic status and by prior mental health status?
2. What are the risks, determinants and expressions of the physical health consequences of long-Covid?
3. What are the disruptions to health care services (primary and secondary), and what are the health consequences of these disruptions?  How do they vary by geography, demographics and socioeconomic status?
4. What are the risks of re-infection?
5. How do measures of historical health & physiology impact risk of C-19 infection and its consequences?  
6. How do we best identify cases in population studies, triangulating symptoms, antigen and antibody testing?  How do antibody profiles differ by case status (e.g. those with and without symptoms), how do antibody profiles vary over time? What are the health determinants of such variability?
7. What are the long term socioeconomic consequences of viral suppression measures?  How do these in turn impact on health and on health care utilisation?

Scarring of the internal organs occurs in many common diseases, including diabetes (scarring in the pancreas), hypertension (blood vessels), chronic kidney disease (kidney), cirrhosis (liver) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (lungs). Within the consortium we have full spectrum of single organ fibrosis, including lung (n=1150), liver (n=1930), pancreas (n=1480), small bowel (n=1193), kidney (n=1700), as well as brain, bone marrow, and diabetes cohorts.
The aim of our research is to identify patterns of scarring in different organs, which we have termed Fibrotic Multi-Morbidity (FMM), and to understand how and why the scarring gets worse. We will use new technology such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to measure the amount of scarring in different organs to generate a Total Body Fibrosis Score. 
In this way, we hope to be able to stop scarring from destroying the organ in which it is found and prevent it spreading to other organs by using a single treatment for scarring. Ultimately, by understanding the causes of scarring and reasons that worsen the scarring we will prevent the long-term problems that occur when people get scarring in multiple organs in the body.",1,Armando,Mendez Villalon,armando.mendez@nottingham.ac.uk,Yes,,

Gut Reaction: Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Gut Reaction: Inflammatory Bowel Disease,"Gut Reaction is the Health Data Research Hub for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). IBD includes Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.

Together, these conditions affect around 500,000 people in the UK. They cause recurring abdominal symptoms, which need long-term treatment and often major surgery. As as result, IBD can significantly affect the lives of those who live with it.

Gut Reaction aims to build on the high-quality health data in the NIHR IBD BioResource by combining it with ‘real-world’ data from participating NHS hospitals, audit and Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) from the IBD Registry and genomic data from the UK IBD Genetics Consortium. This will allow researchers to use the pooled data to support important research into IBD.

Gut Reaction is working with hospitals, industry and, most importantly, patients to create a unique, secure data resource for scientists in order to speed research for people living with IBD.

Gut Reaction will create the world’s largest virtual repository of data from people with IBD. It will contain information from more than 34,000 IBD patients who have consented to participate in the NIHR BioResource, including over 7,000 patients for whom detailed hospital records are also held; with similar numbers of participants (who are not necessarily the same people) in both the IBD Registry and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium.  Researchers can search the metadata on available data sets and apply for access to the subsets of data to support their research.

Through Gut Reaction’s partner organisations AIMES - who provide secure infrastructure - and Privitar - who provide Privacy Enhancing Technologies - researchers can apply to access robustly de-identified data in a trusted location.

Together, this will enable approved researchers to rapidly identify, access and analyse high-quality IBD data, thereby driving discovery and innovation.

Through the NIHR BioResource, it is also possible to access samples to accompany the data, and to invite people with IBD to take part in clinical studies and trials that might be suitable for them.

HDR UK Multi-omics Consortium ,HDR UK Multi-omics Consortium ,"Genetics has transformed our understanding of how variation in DNA can influence risk of developing conditions, such as cancer and heart disease. Studies that can combine this genetic information with other blood-based factors – including proteins, metabolites and lipids – and health records, have the potential to provide more direct insight into disease aetiology and prediction. A key challenge so far, however, has been accessing this information at sufficient scale.

The development of a National Multi-omics Consortium aims to address this challenge by bringing together information on participants from multiple studies to enhance scientific power, breadth, and robustness. The Consortium is one of the major initiatives within HDRUK’s Understanding the Causes of Disease programme, led by HDR UK Researcher Dr Adam Butterworth. It will bring together existing and unique data assets, maximising their value within an open and collaborative national team. 

From it's conception, the Consortium was designed to include nine longitudinal UK population cohorts within the HDR UK network, comprising over 750,000 participants:
- AIRWAVE Health Monitoring
- COMPARE Study
- EPIC-Norfolk
- The Fenland Study
- Generation Scotland
- GoDARTS
- INTERVAL Study 
- UCLEB Consortium
- UK Biobank

Additional cohorts have since joined, including:
- ALSPAC
- Born in Bradford
- EXCEED
- Viking Genes (including both Viking & Orcades studies)

More info can be found [here](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/projects/a-national-multi-omics-consortium-to-inform-disease-aetiology-and-prediction/). This collection will feature datasets, projects and outputs from the HDR UK Multi-omics Consortium.

HDR UK Multimorbidity Implementation Platform,HDR UK Multimorbidity Implementation Platform,"The UK Academy of Medical Sciences defines multimorbidity as the co-existence of two or more long-term conditions. Multimorbidity is common in the UK and the health service is having to treat greater numbers of patients with more than one disease or condition.  We aim to find out more about what diseases and conditions are found together, how they develop as people age and also which cause the most problems for people and the health service.

We have worked with researchers across all four nations in the UK to utilise 6 different datasets which hold anonymised information on over 10 million people to explore multimorbidity in the UK at a scale never done before. We have developed a framework which holds 20 years of longitudinal data for all patients aged 25 or over on 1st January 2000, including linked hospital (not all sites), primary care (not all sites),  prescribing, disease registry and demographic records.

We have performed a systematic review to explore variations in the measurement of multimorbidity and also worked with clinicians, researchers and the public to define how best they think we should measure multimorbidity and which are the important conditions to examine.  We have also worked with a UK wide patient and public panel to get their input to the project but also to explore how best to involve patients and the public in health data science research.

We have supported HDR UK strategy by developing the ability to use data at scale across UK for research with a distributed team of health data scientists and would plan for this work to inform other HDR UK activities.  The consolidated datasets are listed below:
•	CALIBER Multimorbidity Cohort
•	Discovery Multimorbidity Cohort
•	Leicester, Leicestershire & Rutland Multimorbidity Cohort
•	Northern Ireland Multimorbidity Cohort
•	Scottish Multimorbidity Cohort
•	Wales Multimorbidity Cohort

HDR UK National Text Analytics Project,HDR UK National Text Analytics Project,"When you visit your doctor or attend hospital, information collected about you, including your symptoms, tests, investigations, diagnosis, and treatments, is entered on computers as electronic health records (EHRs). This information could help us learn how to tailor treatments more accurately for individual patients and to offer better and safer healthcare.

The challenge

The challenge we face is that most of the information held within these records is in written form – sometimes referred to as unstructured text – which is difficult to use in research: for example, ‘the patient feels very tired and breathless, is losing weight, and says her heart is beating very fast’. We need to develop special computerised tools to process these words to ensure we have a full picture of all patient symptoms, experiences and diagnoses to use in research for patient benefit.

The solution

We will establish a natural language processing (NLP) research community that will address the complexity of clinical text through development of shared tools and standards with inbuilt patient confidence and engagement, supporting joint working across industry, academia and the NHS. The community will be open and inclusive, and develop capability for UK-wide NLP research at scale whilst providing clear ‘quick-wins’ through exemplar projects, shared material and datasets for training and implementation, with the ultimate aim of integrating with other health data analytics. The project will lay the foundations for a sustainable model for collaborative working, thus attracting funding for next 4 years and beyond.

Impact and outcomes

There is much value in the unstructured portion of the EHR, often in the form of rich narrative, which is currently unused, yet important for understanding health interactions that are either not recorded in, or are less obvious from, the structured data (e.g. multimorbidity, cancer diagnosis). The subtleties of the patient journey and characteristics are often stored in the free-text component and clinicians therefore find it a more user-friendly format.

Building on existing successful partner-led programmes, and drawing the wider community together, this project will enable a major shift in the UK’s ability for research-ready, actionable, real-time and large-scale EHRs. Shared tools will be made available across the NHS, creating richer, more useful clinical information to improve healthcare. The integration of NLP derived phenotypes (digital descriptions of health characteristics) from EHRs with other rich records (e.g. educational and social information) and other modalities including imaging, mobile health and genomics will help generate a more complete picture of the patient and their health. Example projects will focus on areas of stroke, lung cancer and serious mental illness.

Better use of unstructured text will help streamline matching of patients to clinical trials and stratification of patients for disease classification, outcome prediction, patient trajectories across the life-course, adverse drug reactions, and identify drug-repurposing opportunities.

HIV-PiNS,HIV-PiNS,"HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a frequent complication of HIV infection and a major
source of morbidity. A cross-sectional deep profiling study examining HIV-SN was conducted in people
living with HIV in a high resource setting using a battery of measures which included the following:
parameters of pain and sensory symptoms (7 day pain diary, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory [NPSI]
and Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]), sensory innervation (structured neurological examination, quantitative
sensory testing [QST] and intraepidermal nerve fibre density [IENFD]), psychological state (Pain Anxiety
Symptoms Scale-20 [PASS-20], Depression Anxiety and Positive Outlook Scale [DAPOS], and Pain Catastrophizing
Scale [PCS], insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]), and quality of life (Short Form (36)
Health Survey [SF-36]). The diagnostic utility of the Brief Peripheral Neuropathy Screen (BPNS), Utah
Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS), and Toronto Clinical Scoring System (TCSS) were evaluated. Thirty-six
healthy volunteers and 66 HIV infected participants were recruited. A novel triumvirate case definition
for HIV-SN was used that required 2 out of 3 of the following: 2 or more abnormal QST findings, reduced
IENFD, and signs of a peripheral neuropathy on a structured neurological examination. Of those with HIV,
42% fulfilled the case definition for HIV-SN (n = 28), of whom 75% (n = 21) reported pain. The most frequent
QST abnormalities in HIV-SN were loss of function in mechanical and vibration detection. Structured
clinical examination was superior to QST or IENFD in HIV-SN diagnosis. HIV-SN participants had
higher plasma triglyceride, concentrations depression, anxiety and catastrophizing scores, and prevalence
of insomnia than HIV participants without HIV-SN.",0,Andrew ,Rice,a.rice@imperial.ac.uk,,To be contacted,Email sent out on 03/07/2024

**Data Saves Lives: Mental Health** 

The UK is home to some of the best mental health data in the world, and there is enormous potential to use this data to accelerate progress in care and address the longstanding disadvantages faced by people with mental health conditions.

**Data-driven better mental health for all** 

The HDR UK community is leading the way to harness the UK’s data by creating an ecosystem for secure, inclusive and anonymised data research, and supporting cutting-edge mental health data science to improve the lives of people with mental health. Importantly, we’re doing this in partnership with people with lived experiences of mental health conditions, to ensure we’re acting in the best interests of the people who will benefit from this work. 

For **[World Mental Health Day](https://www.who.int/campaigns/world-mental-health-day/2022)**, HDR UK launched a campaign focussed on the important role that data has in reducing mental health care inequalities - hear from our community, explore events to celebrate better mental health for all, explore tools and resources that support mental health data research, and meet our mental health experts.

"MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD, 1946 British birth cohort study)","MRC National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD, 1946 British birth cohort study)","The Medical Research Council (MRC) National Survey of Health and Development (NSHD) is the oldest and longest running of the British birth cohort studies; it is a nationally representative sample (N=5,362) of men and women born in England, Scotland or Wales in March 1946.

From an initial maternity survey of 13,687 of all births recorded in England, Scotland and Wales during one week of March, 1946, a socially stratified sample of 5,362 singleton babies born to married parents was selected for follow-up. This sample comprises the NSHD cohort and participants have been studied 25 times.

Today, with study members in their seventies, the NSHD is a leading source of evidence on the long-term biological and social processes of ageing and how ageing is affected by factors acting across the whole of life.

The participants have been followed up in the course of 25 data collections. Regular interviews with the mothers were conducted by health visitors, with additional assessments by school doctors and teachers. In adult life, research nurses conducted home visits at ages 26,36,43,53 and 69, a detailed clinic visit took place between ages 60-64, as well as clinical sub studies focusing on the heart and brain (Insight46). At the latest home visit at age 69, the participation rate was 80% (N=2149). In addition to regular postal questionnaires throughout life, there have been annual questionnaires to women (47-54 years) to capture the menopause transition and 3 waves of a COVID-19 questionnaires, conducted in collaborations with CLS.

During childhood, the main aim of the NSHD was to investigate how the environment at home and at school affected physical and mental development and educational attainment. During adulthood, the main aim has been to investigate how childhood development and lifetime social circumstances and lifestyle affected adult health and function and how these change with age. Now that participants have reached their seventies, the NSHD has developed into a life course study of ageing.",1,Andrew,Wong,andrew.wong@ucl.ac.uk,Yes,,

NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre,NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre,"The Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre is a new five-year programme of translational research here in Nottingham (2022-2027).

Who we are: 
We are a partnership primarily between the University of Nottingham (UoN) and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH). We bring our world class scientists, clinicians and research professionals together to work collaboratively to deliver tomorrow's world-class healthcare across eight research themes.

Our heritage: 
We first launched the NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre in April 2017. Since our launch, we have added to scientific knowledge by publishing 2342 papers, helped build the research community of the future by supporting 383 trainees and leveraged £182m of external funding.

Our role: 
We develop new treatments for diseases that affect millions of people in the UK and world-wide. We take discoveries from scientists in Nottingham, and other world-leading universities, and develop them into new drugs and medical technologies. 

Our research is focused on health problems where there is the greatest international, national, and local need, where our research teams are internationally renowned, and where Nottingham has significant investment in place specifcially:
- Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (SPMIC)
-  £100M BioDiscovery Institute at UoN. 

Working with industry: 
Our research is also about improving prosperity by working with industry. Our mission is to grow our partnerships with the regional industry economy by working with the Midlands Academic Health Science Network, the Midlands Health Alliance, the new National Rehabilitation Centre (opening 2024) and the Medical Technologies Innovation Facility (MTIF) hosted by Nottingham Trent University.

Inclusive research in Nottingham: 
We believe that the quality, value and impact of our research can only be realised through by strong public and patient involvement and engagement. Our research involves communities who are at greatest risk from the diseases we study, and our aim is to reduce health inequalities. The life expectancy in Nottinghamshire is below average, with people in the most deprived areas having a life expectancy 14 years lower than other areas. There are also big differences in access to healthcare and an increased number of patients with mental health, respiratory and liver diseases.

We have are developing a dedicated programme for increasing the diversity of people who contribute to and take part in our research, as well as ensuring that our BRC is directly linked to our communities. We are working to remove the barriers to taking part in research for both the people who work in our Centre and for those who support and take part in our research.",1,Esmond,Urwin,esmond.urwin@nottingham.ac.uk,Yes,,

ONS Secure Research Service,ONS Secure Research Service,"The Secure Research Service (SRS) operates within the Five Safes Framework, which is a set of principles that safeguard access to the sensitive data that are available for use by appropriately trained and accredited members of the research community. SRS is an accredited data processor under the Digital Economy Act 2017 (the Act). What this means is that the SRS does not own the data that is made available through the service and data owners are separately identified in the Act. Whenever the SRS acquires data that is to be made available to the research community, an agreement is signed with the data owners that specifies the conditions under which data can be accessed and any restrictions that may be placed on individual datasets. As part of this process, data owners typically wish to know information about how Five Safes will apply to their dataset.

Outbreak Investigation - NCS COVID-19 Transmssion and Environment,Outbreak Investigation - NCS COVID-19 Transmssion and Environment,"We are exploring the existing data landscapes and opportunities for data linkages to support statistical analysis and modelling, in order to understand and monitor SARS-CoV-2 transmission and rates of COVID-19 outbreaks in occupational settings in Great Britain

For investigation of where transmission occurs

Key research questions 

1.	Where, in which settings, SARS-CoV-2 transmission is occurring?
2.	How can we measure the relative risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by setting type and location, so that we can target areas where risk of transmission and risk of outbreak are high?
3.	How can we measure and monitor the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants in different settings? 
4.	How can we identify the type of settings and their characteristics (occupants, behaviours, environment and controls) that can be associated with an increased or decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission? 
5.	How can we develop a model to predict the risk of COVID-19 outbreaks in certain settings and locations; and how can we validate and improve the predictive ability of the model?

PIONEER: Health Data Research Hub for Acute Care,PIONEER: Health Data Research Hub for Acute Care,"PIONEER is the Health Data Research Hub for Acute Care, led by the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, in partnership with West Midlands Ambulance Service. Acute care is the provision of unplanned medical care; from out of hours primary care, ambulance assessment, emergency medicine, surgery and intensive care. Demand for acute health services are currently unsustainable for our national healthcare resource and this has been particularly highlighted in first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Despite this, there has been less innovation in acute care than in many others health sectors, in part due to siloed information about patients with acute illnesses.   

PIONEER is changing this, by linking patient data from individual healthcare providers to understand, for the first time, the health journeys people undertake when they are suddenly unwell. The PIONEER Hub collects and curates individually linked  acute care data from across the health economy, including primary, secondary, social care, and ambulance data. PIONEER uses this data to:

• provide accurate, real-time data for capacity planning and service innovation,

• support learning healthcare systems including better use of current/novel investigations, treatments and pathways,

• map innovation need. 

Ultimately, PIONEER enables stakeholders to develop, test, and deliver new ways of caring for acutely unwell people, supported with expert patient, health care professional, and compute/analytic services.

The PROTECT study is a UK-wide research programme improving our understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is transmitted from person to person, and how this varies in different settings and environments. This improved understanding will enable more effective measures to stop transmission, saving lives and getting society back towards ‘normal’.

Led by the Health and Safety Executive’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Professor Andrew Curran, this critical work is being delivered by more than 70 researchers from 16 institutions across the UK. The PROTECT study began in October 2020, as part of the [COVID-19 National Core Studies](https://gbr01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hdruk.ac.uk%2Fcovid-19%2Fcovid-19-national-core-studies%2F&data=04%7C01%7CVicky.Hellon%40hdruk.ac.uk%7C07f29243241043cc4cf208d960943581%7C844cacb1702742639d8a18faa5bf0839%7C1%7C0%7C637647011954409380%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=n4%2FD4EiCvuGeVERQLXcEl%2BNMijBb0fbezZ93Jmd%2FF%2BI%3D&reserved=0) programme spearheaded by UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance. It is currently funded by HM Treasury until March 2022.

The PROTECT study is made up of six themes that use a complementary variety of research methods and scientific disciplines to address the research questions from different angles – including microbiology, epidemiology, building science, behavioural science and mathematical modelling – and ensure findings are turned into practical tools and advice for policymakers.

Theme 1: includes rapid on-the-ground investigations (known as the COVID-OUT study) of outbreaks in workplaces, as well as comprehensive analyses of outbreak data collected within public health and regulatory information systems. The aim is to identify outbreak causes and common risk factors, a better understanding of which will help prevent and control further outbreaks as the UK unlocks. *Led by Drs Yiqun Chen and Derek Morgan, Health and Safety Executive.*

Theme 2: applying a range of cutting-edge modelling and experimental approaches to address the key research questions of the PROTECT study on how the physical environment and human behaviour affect transmission of the COVID-19 virus, how best to control it, and what it really means to be ‘COVID secure’. *Led by Professor Cath Noakes, University of Leeds.*

Theme 3: conducting targeted studies to improve understanding of specific workplace transmission risks and effective control measures within different industrial sectors, helping to support these sectors to return to more normal operation. The sectors being studied include transport, food manufacturing, retail and hospitality. *Led by Professor Martie van Tongeren, University of Manchester.*

Theme 4: developing a range of tools and methods to better understand transmission of the COVID-19 virus in the environment. These are not only crucial to support the delivery of the other PROTECT research themes, but will also help ensure the legacy impact of the study by enhancing the UK’s capability to study respiratory virus transmission in readiness for any future pandemic. *Led by Allan Bennett, Public Health England.*

Theme 5: conducting experimental infections of both human volunteers and animals with SARS-CoV-2 to examine how they emit and transmit the virus, particularly in the early stages after infection. This will answer key questions such as how big a dose of the virus is needed to infect people, and how long afterwards they are most infectious. The UK is the only country in the world conducting such human volunteer studies for COVID-19. *Led by Professor Wendy Barclay, Imperial College London.*

Theme 6: bringing together all the knowledge and evidence created by the other research themes and making it count; translating it into practical policy advice and tools for government, industry and individuals to reduce transmission of the COVID-19 virus and help get society back closer to normal. *Led by Professor Andrew Curran, Health and Safety Executive.*

RECOVERY Trial,RECOVERY Trial,"This national clinical trial aims to identify treatments that may be beneficial for people hospitalised with suspected or confirmed COVID-19

A range of potential treatments have been suggested for COVID-19 but nobody knows if any of them will turn out to be more effective in helping people recover than the usual standard of hospital care which all patients will receive. The RECOVERY Trial is currently testing some of these suggested treatments: 

* Low-dose Dexamethasone  (now only recruiting children)
* Azithromycin (a commonly used antibiotic)
* Tocilizumab (an anti-inflammatory treatment given by injection)
* Convalescent plasma (collected from donors who have recovered from COVID-19 and contains antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus)
* REGN-COV2 (a combination of monoclonal antibodies directed against coronavirus)
* Aspirin (commonly used to thin the blood).  

Data from the trial are regularly reviewed so that any effective treatment can be identified quickly and made available to all patients. Please see our [news page](https://www.recoverytrial.net/news) for results that RECOVERY has already found. The RECOVERY Trial team will constantly review information on new drugs and include promising ones in the trial.  ",,Susheel,Varma,susheel.varma@hdruk.ac.uk,,,

Sprint Exemplar Projects,Sprint Exemplar Projects,"In 2019, eleven projects helped to develop proof of concepts for technology, methodology and research services that are informing the design of the Digital Innovation Hub Programme. The projects also provided early user cases that demonstrated the unique approach of the programme focusing on research services and infrastructure across NHS, academia and industry to enable the utilisation of high value linked datasets for UK scale research.

We received more than 40 applications following the call in October 2018.  All applications were assessed by a specially-constituted multidisciplinary panel chaired by Professor Sir Nigel Shadbolt in December 2018.  Through this process led by the Medical Research Council, ten innovations were selected as the Sprint Exemplar Innovation Projects.  Each of these collaborations of industry, academia and the NHS will deliver their projects during 2019 and are being funded through the UK Research and Innovation Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) investment. One additional Exemplar project was later added.

These exciting projects supported the Digital Innovation Hub Programme in several ways:

- Generated early momentum and engagement during the design phase
- Provided information about current market and idea generation
- Shared early lessons with the wider programme
- Started to build the community. The participants delivered more than their projects – they helped to shape the future of health data science in the UK

Under the projects tab, you can find the initial outlines of their planned work. ",,Clara,Fennessy,clara.fennessy@hdruk.ac.uk,,,
