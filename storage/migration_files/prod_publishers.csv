Organisations and individuals wanting to use the National Neonatal Research Database (NNRD & NNRD-AI) are therefore asked to show they meet data security and information governance standards by completing this application process.\n\nIf you are thinking of using the NNRD/NNRD-AI for research or health services audit or evaluations, please read the following information carefully. We, as do most data custodians, operate on a cost recovery model as we have no core funding. Costs are estimated using a transparent model defined by Imperial College London and based on the amount of data requested, the time required to process and administer your request, and a contribution towards maintaining the National Neonatal Research Database. In order to provide a provisional cost, we will also need to know the study sponsor, and the likely funder.\n\n## **Step 1. Starting the Process**\n\nTo start the process, contact the NNRD manager at the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit at Imperial College London by clicking the ‰Û÷Make an enquiry‰Ûª function and providing a brief description of the project and data you require. P**lease ensure you have checked that the NNRD/NNRD-AI contains the data you require by reviewing the data specification.** You will receive a message explaining next steps; if you do not receive a message within 5 days please contact ndau@imperial.ac.uk, directly.\n\nIn your enquiry, please be sure to answer the following questions:\n‰Û¢    Please specify the data items required (using the NNRD/NNRD-AI Data Dictionary)\n‰Û¢    Do you require any derived items? If so, can you provide the definition/s you would like to use?\n‰Û¢    How many (complete or part) years of NNRD/NNRD-AI data are required?\n‰Û¢    Please specify the start date and end date for the period of data required.\n‰Û¢    From which countries do you require data (England; Wales; Scotland)?\n‰Û¢    Does your study involve de-identified data, or consented data?\n‰Û¢    Will you require a single or a multiple data extraction?\n\n## **Step 2. Submitting an application**\n\nIf you receive a message asking you to complete the data access request form, click the ‰Û÷Request Access‰Ûª button. Please read through the pre-application checklist in the ‰Û÷About this application‰Ûª page and confirm that you have read the guidance.

Please contact the NNRD manager at the Neonatal Data Analysis Unit if you are uncertain about any aspect of the form.\n\n## **Step 3. NNRD Steering Board Evaluation**\n\nThe NNRD Office will evaluate the proposal. The Steering Board is notified of all requests and is formally asked to approve all commercially sponsor studies. The NNRD Office considers proposals at an  early stage to be certain that the research question can be answered using the NNRD or NNRD-AI, and has public benefit.\n\n## **Step 4. Regulatory Approvals**\n\nIf the proposal is approved, the applicant is required to obtain all regulatory approvals. Please be advised that:\n‰Û¢    All research projects involving the NNRD/NNRD-AI require UK National Research Ethics Committee approval\n‰Û¢    The use of Scottish neonatal data requires additional approval from the Public Benefit and Privacy Panel for Health and Social Care\n‰Û¢    HRA approval (‰ÛÏR&D approval‰Û) is only required from Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust as the host organisation of the NNRD/NNRD-AI and is not required from each NHS Trust contributing data to the study through the NNRD/NNRD-AI\n‰Û¢    If patient identifiers without patient consent are necessary, the applicant must obtain specific additional approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group\n\n## **Step 5. Agreement of Neonatal Units**\n\nAgreement is sought from all neonatal units contributing data to the NNRD/NNRD-AI for all research studies. Neonatal units are notified by the NNRD manager on behalf of the applicant to invite participation and request agreement. In the case of service evaluations, all neonatal units are notified of the request by the lead organisation. These processes ensure that neonatal units are able to i) decline inclusion of data from their neonatal unit if they wish, and ii) are fully informed about national initiatives.\n\n## **Step 6. Data Sharing Agreement**\n\nOnce all approvals are received, applicants are asked to sign a Data Sharing Agreement that specifies the purpose for which the data are to be used, confirmation that the costs will be met, and the acknowledgements to be made, including that all contributing Trusts, Networks, Lead Clinicians, and other contributing members of the UK Neonatal Collaborative, as appropriate, are acknowledged in all outputs.\n\n## **Step 7. Data Extraction and Analysis**\n\nUpon receipt of the Data Sharing Agreement, the NNRD team will proceed with data extraction (and analyses if requested) and provide an estimation of the time to completion.\n\n**Additional information**\nWe recommend data users undertake an Information Governance accreditation course; e.g.:\n‰Û¢    Safe Researcher Training course and online assessment; run by ONS, the UK Data Service or the Administrative Data Research UK partners.\n‰Û¢    MRC Research, GDPR and confidentiality: what you really need to know",,,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,3.52639E+16,2023-01-17T10:46:58.759Z,3.52639E+16,2023-08-15T15:27:36.996Z,2.28505E+16,2023-01-19T09:26:18.214Z,,,,,

Who we are: We are a partnership primarily between the University of Nottingham (UoN) and Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (NUH). We bring our world class scientists, clinicians and research professionals together to work collaboratively to deliver tomorrow's world-class healthcare across eight research themes.

Our heritage: We first launched the NIHR Nottingham Biomedical Research Centre in April 2017. Since our launch, we have added to scientific knowledge by publishing 2342 papers, helped build the research community of the future by supporting 383 trainees and leveraged £182m of external funding.

Our role: We develop new treatments for diseases that affect millions of people in the UK and world-wide. We take discoveries from scientists in Nottingham, and other world-leading universities, and develop them into new drugs and medical technologies.

Our research is focused on health problems where there is the greatest international, national, and local need, where our research teams are internationally renowned, and where Nottingham has significant investment in place specifcially:

Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (SPMIC)
£100M BioDiscovery Institute at UoN.
Working with industry: Our research is also about improving prosperity by working with industry. Our mission is to grow our partnerships with the regional industry economy by working with the Midlands Academic Health Science Network, the Midlands Health Alliance, the new National Rehabilitation Centre (opening 2024) and the Medical Technologies Innovation Facility (MTIF) hosted by Nottingham Trent University.

Inclusive research in Nottingham: We believe that the quality, value and impact of our research can only be realised through by strong public and patient involvement and engagement. Our research involves communities who are at greatest risk from the diseases we study, and our aim is to reduce health inequalities. The life expectancy in Nottinghamshire is below average, with people in the most deprived areas having a life expectancy 14 years lower than other areas. There are also big differences in access to healthcare and an increased number of patients with mental health, respiratory and liver diseases.

We have are developing a dedicated programme for increasing the diversity of people who contribute to and take part in our research, as well as ensuring that our BRC is directly linked to our communities. We are working to remove the barriers to taking part in research for both the people who work in our Centre and for those who support and take part in our research."

One in two people will get cancer during their lifetime. Every year, almost 400,000 new cases are diagnosed in the UK and cancer costs the NHS £7 billion annually. Research has shown that using health data more effectively can help to drive the development of new cancer treatments, therapies and diagnostic services and improve cancer survival rates.

Health data collected by the NHS and other organisations is not always quick and easy for researchers to find, access and analyse. DATA-CAN works in partnership with data custodians in universities, charities, industry and NHS organisations to make high quality health data more accessible for cancer researchers, clinicians and other health professionals. The aim is to make it easier to conduct research into new treatments, identify opportunities for earlier diagnosis, give patients faster access to clinical trials and create new investment in UK healthcare.

DATAMIND is the Health Data Research Hub for Mental Health funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC).

Our Mental Health Data Research Hub makes the most of the UKÕs rich mental health data and enables coordinated research, with the aim of improving peopleÕs lives. The Hub transforms mental health research in the UK by providing a central, integrated data infrastructure with <b>findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR)<b> mental health data sets. This means data from diverse sources, underpinned by expertise and innovation, by principles of responsible use, and by public participation, for use across universities, the NHS, the charitable sector, policymakers, and industry.

In partnership with the charity MQ: Transforming Mental Health, the hub supports the development of the publicÕs involvement in mental health research to ensure that valuable contributions are included from those with lived experience. The hub also collaborates with MQ to build capacity and strengthen expertise in this increasingly important area of research through data science conferences and early career researcher (ECR) skills development workshops.

The Hub infrastructure is located at four lead sites covering the four UK nations. We index and curate data across participating organisations for research, development, and innovation. The Hub continuously catalogues relevant UK data rich in mental health information, including from gene studies, routine care, volunteer cohorts, and trials (often through the Catalogue of Mental Health Measures), as well as novel data from schools and charities. It allows researchers to discover and use them through the HDR UK Innovation Gateway.

Patients and the public are also crucial to DATAMIND, ensuring the project aligns with real-life mental health challenges. The Super Research Advisory Group (SRAG) promotes inclusive decision-making, guided by those directly affected by mental health issues."

IBD includes CrohnÕs disease and ulcerative colitis.

Together, these conditions affect around 500,000 people in the UK. They cause recurring abdominal symptoms, which need long-term treatment and often major surgery. As as result, IBD can significantly affect the lives of those who live with it.

Gut Reaction aims to build on the high-quality health data in the NIHR IBD BioResource by combining it with Ôreal-worldÕ data from participating NHS hospitals, audit and Patient Reported Outcomes Measures (PROMs) from the IBD Registry and genomic data from the UK IBD Genetics Consortium. This will allow researchers to use the pooled data to support important research into IBD.

Gut Reaction is working with hospitals, industry and, most importantly, patients to create a unique, secure data resource for scientists in order to speed research for people living with IBD.

Gut Reaction will create the worldÕs largest virtual repository of data from people with IBD. It will contain information from more than 34,000 IBD patients who have consented to participate in the NIHR BioResource, including over 7,000 patients for whom detailed hospital records are also held; with similar numbers of participants (who are not necessarily the same people) in both the IBD Registry and the UK IBD Genetics Consortium. Researchers can search the metadata on available data sets and apply for access to the subsets of data to support their research.

Through Gut ReactionÕs partner organisations AIMES - who provide secure infrastructure - and Privitar - who provide Privacy Enhancing Technologies - researchers can apply to access robustly de-identified data in a trusted location.

Together, this will enable approved researchers to rapidly identify, access and analyse high-quality IBD data, thereby driving discovery and innovation.

Through the NIHR BioResource, it is also possible to access samples to accompany the data, and to invite people with IBD to take part in clinical studies and trials that might be suitable for them.

Acute care is the provision of unplanned medical care; from out of hours primary care, ambulance assessment, emergency medicine, surgery and intensive care. Demand for acute health services are currently unsustainable for our national healthcare resource and this has been particularly highlighted in first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, there has been less innovation in acute care than in many others health sectors, in part due to siloed information about patients with acute illnesses.

PIONEER is changing this, by linking patient data from individual healthcare providers to understand, for the first time, the health journeys people undertake when they are suddenly unwell. The PIONEER Hub collects and curates individually linked acute care data from across the health economy, including primary, secondary, social care, and ambulance data. PIONEER uses this data to:

¥ provide accurate, real-time data for capacity planning and service innovation,

¥ support learning healthcare systems including better use of current/novel investigations, treatments and pathways,

¥ map innovation need.

Ultimately, PIONEER enables stakeholders to develop, test, and deliver new ways of caring for acutely unwell people, supported with expert patient, health care professional, and compute/analytic services."

What this means is that the SRS does not own the data that is made available through the service and data owners are separately identified in the Act. Whenever the SRS acquires data that is to be made available to the research community, an agreement is signed with the data owners that specifies the conditions under which data can be accessed and any restrictions that may be placed on individual datasets. As part of this process, data owners typically wish to know information about how Five Safes will apply to their dataset.

It aims to understand the relationship between COVID-19 and cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack, heart failure, stroke, and blood clots in the lungs through analyses of de-identified, pseudonymised, linked, nationally collated health datasets across the four nations of the UK.

The consortium has over 380 members across more than 50 institutions including data custodians, data scientists with methodological and analytical expertise and clinicians, all of whom have signed up to an agreed set of principles with an inclusive, open and transparent ethos.

Approved researchers access data within secure trusted research environments (TREs) provided by NHS England in England, the National Data Safe Haven in Scotland, the SAIL Databank in Wales and the Honest Broker Service in Northern Ireland.

Linkable datasets include those from primary and secondary care, COVID lab tests and vaccinations, deaths, critical care, prescribing/dispensing, cardiovascular and stroke audits, maternity services and mental health.

Building on the success of CVD-COVID-UK, the BHF Data Science Centre has now gained ethical and regulatory approval to broaden the scope of the programme to all COVID-related research (in NHS EnglandÕs TRE for England only). This is known as COVID-IMPACT and it helps to support research projects from the wider community.
