Most access to data in the Secure Research Service (SRS) will be by researchers accredited under the Digital Economy Act 2017 (DEA). \n\nThe UK Statistics Authority has published further information on the criteria to be met in a Research Code of Practice and Accreditation criteria. Researchers can apply for accreditation through the Research Accreditation Service (RAS).\n\nFull accredited researcher status is valid for five years. Provisional accredited researcher status is valid for one year.\n\nMore information here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-economy-act-2017-part-5-codes-of-practice/research-code-of-practice-and-accreditation-criteria#section-b-accreditation-of-researchers-and-peer-reviewers\n\nPlease note if you only need to review cleared outputs from the research, you do NOT need to be accredited for this purpose.",

Safe settings encompass the physical environment and procedural arrangements such as the supervision and auditing regimes. For safe settings, the likelihood of both deliberate and accidental disclosure needs to be explicitly considered.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to ensure that:\n\n- researchers access requested data in a secure and controlled setting such as a Trusted Research Environment (TRE) that limits the unauthorised use of the data\n- practical controls and appropriate restrictions are in place if researchers access data though non-TRE environment. There may be requirements that data is held on restricted access servers, encrypted and only decrypted at the point of use.",
