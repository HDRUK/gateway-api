natriuretic peptides are special proteins produced by the heart, with the two key types being bnp and nt-probnp. nt-probnp is particularly useful in managing heart failure and assessing the risk of heart problems. this marker is not just for heart failure; studies have suggested that nt-probnp levels during the acute phase of sepsis may be a useful indicator of higher risk of long-term impairments in physical function and muscle strength in sepsis survivors.

this dataset includes detailed demographic information, comorbidities and admission reasons and journeys for patients who have required an intensive care admission.  the data includes serial physiological and blood test measurements reflecting the severity of the patient’s condition, imaging and other investigative results, treatments, and outcomes. this data is invaluable in identifying the clinical utility of nt-probnp as a potential prognostic marker for future complications and mortality.

annually in the uk, around 60,000 people develop a pulmonary embolism (pe) and 200,000 a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and the number of emergency admissions for suspected pe and dvt is increasing. diagnosing pe and dvt remains a challenge due to the non-specific nature of presenting symptoms. further tests are often required and each year the number of ctpas and uss performed for suspected vte increases. 

there is great interest in finding better tools to identify those with the highest likelihood of a dvt and pe, so that precious screening services can be focused where needed most. a number of tools have been suggested but few have been adopted in clinical practice. 

methods such as age-adjusted d-dimer tests and 4peps and 4d scores aim to predict pe and dvt more accurately. implementing a more precise system could revolutionise how we diagnose and treat these dangerous conditions. this dataset enables an exploration of vte to better understand disease, identify patients at most risk of the poorest outcomes and to improve health services through the development of new prognostic tools.

further to the burden of stable copd, patients experience acute exacerbations (aecopd), defined as an acute worsening of symptoms which requires a change in treatment.  these are important events, associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term health impacts. patients who exacerbate frequently are more likely to have a faster decline in lung function, have a lower quality of life and experience adverse cardiovascular events.  whilst there are therapies to reduce exacerbation frequency and treat the acute event, options have limited efficacy and have not changed in overall drug class for many years.

exacerbations are defined by the severity of the symptoms and the treatments involved – so a severe exacerbation is one which requires hospitalisation.  however, in our ageing and increasingly frail population, hospitalisation can be required for even a minor event, if a person is already struggling to cope at home.

people suffering from certain severe illnesses may have a high ‘lactate’ level in their blood. this is particularly common in the following: 

severe infections which the body cannot properly control (sepsis) 

people who have sustained severe injuries (traumatic injury) 

people who are critically unwell with other illnesses (needing treatment in an intensive care unit) 

some patients will develop a high lactate level when they are in hospital. doctors recognise that this indicates the patient is becoming more unwell, but it is often challenging to know exactly what is causing the lactate level to be raised. 

raised lactate level has been associated with worse outcome in other syndromes, including major trauma and undifferentiated critical illness; however healthy individuals may generate very high lactate levels during strenuous exercise from which they recover without any harm. it is unclear whether lactate in itself is harmful to patients. this dataset provides unique insight into the potential role of lactate as not only a biomarker but a therapeutic target in acute illness.

a proportion of medical admissions are suitable for sdec, where they are assessed and treated, but do not require overnight admission to an inpatient bed. this is beneficial for patients, as hospital admission and its associated risks can be avoided. as inpatient admissions increase, it is also important to consider alternative methods of care to reduce pressure on inpatient services. sdec is highlighted in the nhs long term plan, recommending a third of patients in acute services should receive sdec.

the number of medical patients receiving sdec varies between centres. this may relate to local patient populations, but also local availability of services. sdec is often delivered through ambulatory emergency care, as well as the acute medical unit, and multiple additional services can aid delivery, including hospital at home services, and early outpatient review in specialist clinics. these services vary between hospitals.

the pathophysiology of frailty is poorly understood but the immune and endocrine systems appear to be involved in its development or response. age and frailty have been proven to be independently predictive of outcomes in patients admitted with an acute illness. 

in covid-19, routine frailty identification has been used to inform decision making about high level of treatment. this is because frailty usually moderates the effect of age on mortality. anecdotally, this effect has not been recognised by clinicians looking after older covid-19 patients. four papers have been published so far on the effect of frailty on covid-19 with differing results.  however, all papers show the independent predictive value of age when controlling for frailty, which is not usually seen in studies of age and frailty in other acute illnesses.

in recent years, many new strategies have been shown to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular death in patients with coronary artery disease and these are recommended in the 2019 esc guideline for chronic coronary syndromes. 

novel medications for diabetes (sglt2 inhibitors and glp-1 agonists) and lipids (ezetimibe and pcsk-9 inhibitors) have demonstrated reductions in adverse cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease. 

with treatment regimens becoming increasingly complex, it can be unclear which drugs are being used for each patient. this highly granular dataset of >61,000 patients under investigation for or with confirmed acs would enable projects to assess guideline compliance, drug related adverse events and modelling to identify responder and non-responder subgroups.

frailty is a critical measure in health care for evidence-based clinical decision making and an accurate electronic frailty index (efi) at admission will be beneficial to both patients and medical service for prompt and appropriate assessment and management in acute care.

an accurate and valid efi will be beneficial to both patients and emergency care services for prompt and appropriate assessment and management.

since 2020, clinical frailty scale (cfs) was introduced to qe as a way to screen and quantify frailty and fitness of individual patients with covid 19 at admission. essentially, cfs is a value derived from 92 baseline variables (also referred to as deficits) using a cumulative model, although studies have shown feasibility of reducing the number of variables without loss of predictive ability. in addition, cfs is judgement-based and requires specially trained clinicians to perform a series of measurements and determine the presence or absence of each deficit.

an efi that was derived from 31 routinely collected test results showed that it has promising identification power for high risk frailty patients in aged cohort (>65), indicating the potential of having a simpler and more efficient model for frailty estimation.

_annually in the uk, around 60,000 people develop a pulmonary embolism (pe) and 200,000 a deep vein thrombosis (dvt) and the number of emergency admissions for suspected pe and dvt is increasing. diagnosing pe and dvt remains a challenge due to the non-specific nature of presenting symptoms. further tests are often required and each year the number of ctpas and uss performed for suspected vte increases. 

there is great interest in finding better tools to identify those with the highest likelihood of a dvt and pe, so that precious screening services can be focused where needed most. a number of tools have been suggested but few have been adopted in clinical practice. 

methods such as age-adjusted d-dimer tests and 4peps and 4d scores aim to predict pe and dvt more accurately. implementing a more precise system could revolutionise how we diagnose and treat these dangerous conditions. this dataset enables an exploration of vte to better understand disease, identify patients at most risk of the poorest outcomes and to improve health services through the development of new prognostic tools.

acute compartment syndrome (acs) is an emergency orthopaedic condition wherein a rapid rise in compartmental pressure compromises blood perfusion to the tissues leading to ischaemia and muscle necrosis.  this serious condition is often misdiagnosed or associated with significant diagnostic delay, and can lead to limb amputations and death. 

the most common causes of acs are high impact trauma, especially fractures of the lower limbs which account for 40% of acs cases.  acs is a challenge to diagnose and treat effectively, with differing clinical thresholds being utilised which can result in unnecessary osteotomy.  the highly granular synthetic data for over 900 patients with acs provide the following key parameters to support critical research into this condition: 
 
1.	patient data (injury type, location, age, sex, pain levels, pre-injury status and comorbidities) 
2.	 physiological parameters (intracompartmental pressure, ph, tissue oxygenation, compartment hardness) 
3.	muscle biomarkers (creatine kinase, myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase) 
4.	blood vessel damage biomarkers (glycocalyx shedding markers, endothelial permeability markers)

coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) was identified in january 2020.  currently, there have been more than 65million cases and more than 1.5 million deaths worldwide.  some individuals experience severe manifestations of infection, including viral pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ards) and death.  evidence suggests that older patients, those from some ethnic minority groups and those with multiple long-term health conditions have worse outcomes.  this secondary care covid dataset contains granular demographic and morbidity data, supplemented from primary care records, to add to the understanding of patient factors on disease outcomes.

background.
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is a debilitating lung condition characterised by progressive lung function limitation.   copd is an umbrella term and encompasses a spectrum of pathophysiologies including chronic bronchitis, small airways disease and emphysema.  copd caused an estimated 3 million deaths worldwide in 2016, and is estimated to be the third leading cause of death worldwide.  people with copd experience flares in their symptoms, termed exacerbations.  exacerbations are associated with increased mortality, morbidity, a faster decline in lung function and other systemic illness such as heart attacks and strokes.  despite this impact, copd exacerbations are poorly characterised and have been without novel treatments for >30 years.

pioneer geography
the west midlands (wm) has a population of 5.9 million & includes a diverse ethnic & socio-economic mix. there is a higher than average percentage of minority ethnic groups. the west midlands has a high prevalence of copd, reflecting the high rates of smoking and industrial exposure. each day >100,000 people are treated in hospital, see their gp or are cared for by the nhs.

chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) is associated with a high burden of co-morbidities which tend to co-exist in specific disease clusters. recognising their presence enables holistic patient management, but also offers opportunities to identify common biological mechanisms across diseases which might be therapeutically targetable.    

the most common comorbidities in copd include cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and osteoporosis.  often presentations are badged as exacerbations and alternative causes of breathlessness are missed.

acute respiratory failure is commonly encountered in the emergency department (ed). early treatment can have positive effects on long-term outcome. non-invasive ventilation is commonly used for patients with respiratory failure during acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease and congestive heart failure.  for other patients, including neuromuscular dysfunction, mechanical ventilation may be needed. for refractory hypoxemia, new rescue therapies have emerged to help improve the oxygenation, and in some cases mortality. this dataset summarises the demography, admitting complaint, serial physiology, treatments and ventilatory strategies in patients admitted with hypoxaemia. management options and rescue therapies including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are included.
