The Grampian Data Safe Haven (DaSH) is a secure, virtual healthcare data analysis and storage centre established by the University of Aberdeen and NHS Grampian to allow for the secure processing and linking of health data for the Grampian and Scottish population when it is not practicable to obtain consent from individual patients.

The DaSH Research Coordinators can provide advice and support with obtaining the required approvals for DaSH projects. A Permissions Pathway guide explaining the approvals process for DaSH projects is also available. In addition, DaSH have some template application forms with pre-populated information about DaSH that can be used by researchers during the permission application process as appropriate.

DaSH technology ensures unconsented healthcare, social data and other types of sensitive data are accessible for research and clinical purposes whilst protecting individuals’ privacy. Our ethos is built on working with clinicians, researchers and industry partners to improve health and social care by providing a safe and secure environment and enabling cutting-edge research.

The Grampian Data Safe Haven offers bespoke data storage, processing and linkage services based on the individual needs of your research project. The DaSH team works with researchers to provide detailed project planning and data management support whilst ensuring adherence to the highest standards of security and governance and protecting patient confidentiality. 

Each project is supported by a Research Coordinator and Data Analyst to ensure projects adhere to permissions and outputs meet the project specification and comply with information security regulations.

The Grampian Data Safe Haven (DaSH) is a secure, virtual healthcare data analysis and storage centre established by the University of Aberdeen and NHS Grampian to allow for the secure processing and linking of health data for the Grampian and Scottish population when it is not practicable to obtain consent from individual patients.

The DaSH Research Coordinators can provide advice and support in obtaining the required approvals for DaSH projects. A Permissions Pathway guide explaining the approvals process for DaSH projects is also available. In addition, DaSH has some template application forms with pre-populated information about DaSH that can be used by researchers during the permission application process as appropriate.

DaSH technology ensures unconsented healthcare, social data and other types of sensitive data are accessible for research and clinical purposes whilst protecting individuals’ privacy. Our ethos is built on working with clinicians, researchers and industry partners to improve health and social care by providing a safe and secure environment and enabling cutting-edge research.

The Grampian Data Safe Haven offers bespoke data storage, processing and linkage services based on the individual needs of your research project. The DaSH team works with researchers to provide detailed project planning and data management support whilst ensuring adherence to the highest standards of security and governance and protecting patient confidentiality. 

Each project is supported by a Research Coordinator and Data Analyst to ensure projects adhere to permissions and outputs meet the project specification and comply with information security regulations. If you require non-DaSH-held datasets, we can assist with obtaining the relevant approvals, as well as coordinating the request with the data custodians and linkage between datasets.",['ETHICS APPROVAL REQUIRED'],['RESEARCH USE ONLY'],TRE/SDE

Once approved a customer specific TRE is made available with a standard set of leading analytical tools from Microsoft including Azure Databricks, Azure Machine Learning, Azure SQL and Azure Synapse (for large-scale data warehouses). Specific tools can be provided at an additional cost over the standard platform data access charge and the PIONEER team will work with you to determine your exact needs.

In order to access the UK LLC TRE, approved researchers are required to use two-factor authentication. Access to the data will be limited and controlled. For each project, a project-specific space will be created in the UK LLC TRE, which will be accessible only to the approved researchers named on the approved project. The UK LLC TRE is a Windows 10 remote desktop environment. Each approved user will be given access to a series of project-specific database views. These views enable access to datasets approved as part of the project. Researchers can choose which tools or packages to conduct their analyses. Standard packages available include Python, R(+RStudio), Stata and SPSS. Researchers may request other packages by emailing access@ukllc.ac.uk, but these may be subject to licence provision/fee.

Researchers must be ONS Accredited Researchers and the project must be approved by a process coordinated by the UK LLC Applications Team, which includes review by the UK LLC Data Access Committee (DAC) and the individual studies' DACs. Researchers’ access to the TRE will be terminated at the end date of the project or earlier if their ONS Accredited Researcher status expires.

Health data collated from multiple sources is ingested into a secure data lake which will then allow subsets of data to be made available to research teams on approval of a data request. Once approved a customer specific TRE is made available with a standard set of leading analytical tools from Microsoft including Azure Databricks, Azure Machine Learning, Azure SQL and Azure Synapse (for large-scale data warehouses). Specific tools can be provided at an additional cost over the standard platform data access charge and the PIONEER team will work with you to determine your exact needs.

Access to the TRE is managed using the latest virtual desktop technology to provide a safe and secure end-user experience.  By utilising leading edge design PIONEER are able to create TREs rapidly to enable us to service any customer requirement.",['PROJECT SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS'],['GENERAL RESEARCH USE'],TRE/SDE
