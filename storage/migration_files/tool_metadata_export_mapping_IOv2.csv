ARX is a comprehensive open source software for anonymizing sensitive personal data. It supports a wide variety of (1) privacy and risk models, (2) methods for transforming data and (3) methods for analyzing the usefulness of output data. It supports various anonymization techniques, methods for analyzing data quality and re-identification risks and it supports well-known privacy models, such as k-anonymity, l-diversity, t-closeness and differential privacy.
ARX is an open source tool for transforming structured (i.e. tabular) personal data using selected methods from the broad areas of data anonymization and statistical disclosure control. It supports transforming datasets in ways that make sure that they adhere to user-specified privacy models and risk thresholds that mitigate attacks that may lead to privacy breaches. ARX can be used to remove direct identifiers (e.g. names) from datasets and to enforce further constraints on indirect identifiers. Indirect identifiers (or quasi-identifiers, or keys) are attributes that do not directly identify an individual but may together with other indirect identifiers form an identifier that can be used for linkage attacks. It is typically assumed that information about indirect identifiers is available to the attacker (in some form of background knowledge) and that they cannot simply be removed from the dataset (e.g. because they are required later for analyses).",ARX Data Anonymization,"{'features': ['Data Anonymization'], 'topics': []}",https://arx.deidentifier.org/downloads/,0,"{'programmingLanguage': ['Java'], 'category': 'Data Anonymization Tool', 'programmingLanguageVersion': ''}","[{'programmingLanguage': 'Java', 'version': ''}]","Java, ",Java,,Data anonymization,0,,"Apache License, Version 2.0",,,Preparing data for analysis,TRE/SDE operations,,New category for 'Anonymisation'?

WhiteRabbit is a small application that can be used to analyze the structure and contents of a database as preparation for designing an ETL. It comes with RabbitInAHat, an application for interactive design of an ETL to the OMOP Common Data Model with the help of the scan report generated by White Rabbit. WhiteRabbitâ€™s main function is to perform a scan of the source data, providing detailed information on the tables, fields, and values that appear in a field. This scan will generate a report that can be used as a reference when designing the ETL, for instance by using the Rabbit-In-a-Hat tool.

Offers the ability to operate across teams, universities, and datasets while enabling Research IT stakeholders to manage, monitor, and control spending, apply security best practices and comply with corporate governance.

Service Workbench targets Research workloads with out of the box service support for:

    JupyterLabs via Amazon SageMaker with Python Kernels
    Jupyter Notebooks on Amazon EMR + Hail v0.2
    RStudio on EC2
    Windows VM on Amazon EC2
    Linux VM on EC2

Additional product configuration can easily be added to Service Workbench through Service Catalog and be linked to researcher, institutional, and includes support for [AWS Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws) data sets configured by Research IT for their researchers use across the institution.

Platform provides one-click option to admins for easier creation (vending) of new AWS accounts specific to researchers' teams for easier governance.

The code in the GitHub repo is fully functional but is intended as a stand-a-lone evaluation deployment and some foundational AWS knowledge is assumed.

Secondary analyses found increased risk of CVST after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (4.01, 2.08 to 7.71 at 8-14 days), after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (3.58, 1.39 to 9.27 at 15-21 days), and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; increased risk of ischaemic stroke after BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination (1.12, 1.04 to 1.20 at 15-21 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test; and increased risk of other rare arterial thrombotic events after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination (1.21, 1.02 to 1.43 at 8-14 days) and after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. CONCLUSION: Increased risks of haematological and vascular events that led to hospital admission or death were observed for short time intervals after first doses of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines.

The Catalogue provides descriptions of the studies as well as the instruments used to assess mental health and wellbeing. It also includes details on each measure such as the items, informants, response scale and reporting period.

Wastewater catchment area data are essential for wastewater treatment capacity planning and have recently become critical for operationalising wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for COVID-19. Owing to the privatised nature of the water industry in the United Kingdom, the required catchment area datasets are not readily available to researchers. Here, we present a consolidated dataset of 7,537 catchment areas from ten sewerage service providers in the Great Britain, covering more than 96% of the population of England and Wales. We develop a geospatial method for estimating the population resident within each catchment from small area population estimates generated by the Office for National Statistics. The method is more widely applicable to matching electronic health records to wastewater infrastructure. Population estimates are highly predictive of population equivalent treatment loads reported under the European Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. We highlight challenges associated with using geospatial data for wastewater-based epidemiology.",,Available upon request,,,Preparing data for analysis,,,,,,", ","Preparing data for analysis, , "
