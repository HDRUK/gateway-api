Primary hip replacement has its own specific dataset for procedures.\nInitially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of bespoke data collection to support the NJR . This is submitted to NEC Software Solutions (contracted to the NJR) for processing and is used to monitor the quality and safety of patient care and outcomes. \nThis same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the NJR research ready data set.\nNJR data covers all procedures carried out in NHS and independent sector hospitals  in England, Wales (from 2003), Northern Ireland )from 2013), the Isle of Man (from 2015) and the States of Guernsey (from 2019).\nEach NJR record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient treated at an NHS or independent sector hospital, including =>\n• clinical information about surgical indications and operations\n• patient information, such as age group and gender\n• component information, such as the brand and size of prosthesis used\n• outcomes, such as whether a revision procedure has been undertaken\nNJR apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published NJR data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.\nWho NJR data is for\nNJR can provide data for the purpose of healthcare analysis to the NHS, government and others including =>\n• national bodies and regulators, such as the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England, NHS Improvement and the CQC\n• local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)\n• provider organisations\n• government departments\n• researchers and commercial healthcare bodies\n• National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)\n• patients, service users and carers\n• the media\nUses of the statistics\nThe statistics are known to be used for =>\n• national policy making\n• benchmarking performance against other hospital providers or CCGs  \n• academic research\n• analysing service usage and planning change\n• providing advice to ministers and answering a wide range of parliamentary questions\n• national and local press articles\n• international comparison\nMore information can be found at http =>//www.njrcentre.org.uk/njrcentre/",

Primary hip replacement has its own specific dataset for procedures.\nInitially this data is collected during a patient's time at hospital as part of bespoke data collection to support the NJR . This is submitted to NEC Software Solutions (contracted to the NJR) for processing and is used to monitor the quality and safety of patient care and outcomes. \nThis same data can also be processed and used for non-clinical purposes, such as research and planning health services. Because these uses are not to do with direct patient care, they are called 'secondary uses'. This is the NJR research ready data set.\nNJR data covers all procedures carried out in NHS and independent sector hospitals  in England, Wales (from 2003), Northern Ireland )from 2013), the Isle of Man (from 2015) and the States of Guernsey (from 2019).\nEach NJR record contains a wide range of information about an individual patient treated at an NHS or independent sector hospital, including =>\n• clinical information about surgical indications and operations\n• patient information, such as age group and gender\n• component information, such as the brand and size of prosthesis used\n• outcomes, such as whether a revision procedure has been undertaken\nNJR apply a strict statistical disclosure control in accordance with the NHS Digital protocol, to all published NJR data. This suppresses small numbers to stop people identifying themselves and others, to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.\nWho NJR data is for\nNJR can provide data for the purpose of healthcare analysis to the NHS, government and others including =>\n• national bodies and regulators, such as the Department of Health, NHS England, Public Health England, NHS Improvement and the CQC\n• local Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs)\n• provider organisations\n• government departments\n• researchers and commercial healthcare bodies\n• National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)\n• patients, service users and carers\n• the media\nUses of the statistics\nThe statistics are known to be used for =>\n• national policy making\n• benchmarking performance against other hospital providers or CCGs  \n• academic research\n• analysing service usage and planning change\n• providing advice to ministers and answering a wide range of parliamentary questions\n• national and local press articles\n• international comparison\nMore information can be found at http =>//www.njrcentre.org.uk/njrcentre/",
