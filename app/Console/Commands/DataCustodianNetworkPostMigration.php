Coordinated by Research Data Scotland, the network is made up of four accredited regional Safe Havens (DaSH, Data Loch, Glasgow, and HIC) and one national Safe Haven (eDRIS) that cover the entire Scottish population of 5.4 million. The network, which was established to provide researchers with a data access service that uses secure computing environments that comply with the "Five Safes”, operates under the Safe Haven Charter and has gained extensive expertise in data linkage. The regional Safe Havens have access to detailed, individual-level data such as laboratory data, hospital visits, and digital echocardiograms (ECGs), while the national Safe Haven provides access to whole population data such as the Scottish Mortality Records.',
